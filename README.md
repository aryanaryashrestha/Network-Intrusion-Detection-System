# üõ°Ô∏è Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

A real-time **Network Intrusion Detection System** built with **Python, Scapy, PostgreSQL, Flask, and Docker**.  
This project captures live network traffic, detects suspicious activities such as **port scans**, **SYN floods**, and **unauthorized access attempts**, and logs alerts into a PostgreSQL database.  
A **Flask-based dashboard** provides visualization of alerts, severity trends, and intrusion statistics to improve monitoring and analysis capabilities.
